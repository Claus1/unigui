# unigui #
Universal App Browser

### Purpose ###
Provide programming technology that does not require client programming, for a server written in any language, for displaying on any device, in any resolution, without any turning.

### How to work inside ###
The exchange protocol for the solution is JSON as the most universally accessible, comprehensible, readable, and popular format compatible with all programming languages.  The server sends JSON data to App Browser which has built-in tools (autodesigner) that allows you to easily generate a beautiful GUI that conforms to Googleâ€™s Material Design standard.
From the constructed Unigui screen the server receives a JSON message flow which fully describes what the user did. The message format is ["Block", "Elem", "type of action", "value(some JSON)"], where "Block"and "Elem"are the names of the block and its element, "value" is the value of the action/event that has happened.
The server can either accept the change or roll them back by sending an info window about any inconsistencies. The server can open a dialog box that is described as a block or send an entirely new screen. uniGUI instantly displays current server data and their changes. 

### Programming ###
The program directory has to contain a folder screens. The folder contains all screens which the Unigui has to show.
Example.

screens/main.py
```
name = "Main" #name of screen to show
icon = 'blur_linear' #MD icon of screen to show
order = 0 #order in the program menu
#add widgets to the screen
table = Table('Videos', headers = ['Video', 'Duration', 'Owner', 'Status', 'Links'],   rows = [
    ['opt_sync1_3_0.mp4', '30 seconds', 'Admin', 'Processed', 'Refererence 1'],
    ['opt_sync1_3_0.mp4', '37 seconds', 'Admin', 'Processed', 'Refererence 8']
], value = 0)
#widgets are groped in blocks (complex widgets with logic)
block = Block('X Block', 
    [   Select('Select', value='All', options=['All','Based','Group']),
        Select('Group', value='Group1', options=['Group 1','Group 2', 'Group 3'])
    ], table)
#what to show on the screen
blocks = [block] 
```

### Server start ###
```
import unigui
unigui.start('Test app', 8080) #app name to show in Unigui and port for initial connection
```
Unigui builds the interactive app on client side for the code above:
